# 📚 Library Management System

Welcome to the **Library Management System** project – a simple Python-based CLI application designed to display book information based on user input.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project allows users to view details of 5 pre-defined books by entering a corresponding input number. The system then displays specific information related to the selected book such as:

- 📖 **Title**
- ✍️ **Author**
- 🏷️ **Price**
- 🗓️ **Publish Date**
- 📝 **Description**

---

## 🛠️ Technology Used

- 🐍 **Python** – Core programming language used to build the application.
- 💻 **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** – For user interaction.

## 📘 How It Works

1. The system contains information for 5 books with unique IDs: `101`, `102`, `103`, `104`, and `105`.
2. The user is prompted to:
   - Enter `1` to view book info for `Book ID: 101`
   - Enter `2` to view book info for `Book ID: 102`
   - Enter `3` to view book info for `Book ID: 103`
   - Enter `4` to view book info for `Book ID: 104`
   - Enter `5` to view book info for `Book ID: 105`
3. Based on the user's input, relevant book details are displayed.
